            <p>The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that
                progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test
                will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly,
                but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should
                be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight
                line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before
                the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark,
                get ready, start.</p>

                <h3>Minesweeper in Android Studio</h3>
                <p>I've taken a liking to using Java from several of my classes, and decided to try
                    to learn Android Studio, which uses this programming language. This project was
                    my take of the game MineSweeper. I worked alone for a couple hours per day over
                    the course of a week. I included several features to challenge myself, including
                    saving score between difference instances, sound, and the ability to detect when
                    the phone is shaken to add depth to gameplay.
