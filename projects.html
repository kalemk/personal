                <h2>Turning Pi Based Private Cloud</h2>
                <!--<img src="" alt="Project 0">-->
                <p>
                    Worked with a group of 6 people in Senior Design to create our
                    own containerized private cloud for storage of media files and
                    streaming capibility. This design utilizes 3 compute modules
                    on a Turing Pi 2 board. I worked as a part of the software team
                    to add functionality including a web player, permissions manager,
                    and upload and download capibility. This project was the most
                    in-depth I have worked on and learned extensive documentation
                    and professional development practices along with the technical 
                    skills required to complete the aforementioned requirements.

                <h2>Minesweeper in Android Studio</h2>
                <img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
                <p>Worked individually using Java in Android Studio to create
                    a Minesweeper game application with a few bonus features.
                    This project helped me gain a better understanding of object-oriented
                    programming in android studio as well as being able to develop
                    and integrate new features and updates to software.

                <h2>Processor Simulation</h2>
                <img src="images/project2.png" alt="Project 2">
                <p>Worked with a partner using VHDL to simulate a pipelined basic
                    piplined single core of a MIPS processor from scratch. Utilized 
                    dataflow and structural architectures with an emphasis on structural.
                    This project helped me gain a better understanding of computer design 
                    and how processing instructions works.</p>

                <p>Worked in a group environment to modify an iRobot using C to navigate
                    an obstacle course controlled via Wi-Fi. I learned how to modify ports
                    and managed to get a better look into how embedded systems interact with
                    the rest of a machine.  </p>
