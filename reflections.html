            <h1>Reflections</h1>
            <h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
            <pre class="reflection">                     My time at Iowa State has been a very enriching experience. I have met many new people, joined several 
                groups, and worked up to a few leadership positions. The course load I have taken so far has been 
                strenuous yet achievable with a fathomable amount of effort. With my scholarly and extracurricular 
                experience and 1.5 semesters to go, I will be ready to tackle the professional world by the time I 
                graduate, thanks to some core experiences.   
                    A common theme from my classmates is that “group work sucks.” I understand its potential downsides, 
                but these group-based classes have helped me grow the most as a student and soon-to-be professional. 
                Having a team to work with started as more of a hindrance from my perspective. I wasn’t allowed to 
                go and get everything done my way. I wasn’t guaranteed to work on projects that I wanted to. I had 
                to work with other people’s schedules. These examples stressed me out and added to my resentment of 
                the class. It wasn’t until midterms came around that I started to see the beauty of group work. The 
                workload started to pick up. The course content was getting progressively more difficult. I was 
                understanding new content less and less. I eventually had no choice but to ask for help. I was 
                unfamiliar with it, so it was understandably something I found difficult to do. My team members 
                were nothing short of imperative in assisting me whenever I asked for it, and they began to feel 
                comfortable enough to ask me for help, too. On top of that, I managed to befriend a few of these 
                teammates and gain their perspectives on content beyond coursework. Their backgrounds, which I 
                previously found difficult to consider, opened my eyes to how uniquely individuals progress through 
                life. Also, they exposed me to nearly all the extracurricular groups and clubs I partook in.  
                    I found myself focused and stressed out on my schoolwork during COVID-19 times during my freshman 
                and the first half of my sophomore year. I had no outlet to do anything else, and exploring club 
                opportunities with a compromised immune system was hard. I ended up listening to my peers and 
                decided to join some clubs that didn’t have much face-to-face contact, but I’ll be talking 
                primarily about the Gaming and eSports club. I played on several teams in games that required 
                constant, fast-paced communication and adaptability. We had to solve whatever problems the 
                opponent threw at us as a unit of 5-6 people in less than 5 seconds over and over. Being new 
                to the program was a tough adjustment, but I managed to become a team captain for one team, 
                and I’m coaching another. It wasn’t easy to accept these leadership roles at first, as I was 
                used to having others step up for me. Using these upperclassmen as my role models, I’m doing my 
                best and leading alongside my team to become the best that we can be.
                    The biggest lesson I have learned is that being uncomfortable is good. Whenever I find myself 
                not wanting to do something but completing it with all the effort I can muster, it has created 
                my most vivid and happy memories. I’m learning to enjoy feeling ill at ease because that means 
                I can learn something new. This progression I’m seeing when I buckle up and really set my mind 
                to something new is very satisfying. I’m not planning on furthering my education in grad 
                school, yet I’m excited to join the workforce in a constantly evolving field where I can 
                continue to adapt with it.<br><br></pre>
            <h2>General Education Reflection</h2>
            <pre class="reflection">                    To obtain a Computer Engineering degree, you’re required to take a plethora of difficult classes about
                the inner workings of a computer and how it functions, which is expected. Taking similar courses
                constantly can take a toll on the student, as they have for me. Fortunately, we’re also required to take
                some general education courses (gen eds) to give us a bit of a break and allow us to explore what else
                is out there.
                    Music 102: Intro to Music Listening and Music 304: History of American Rock ‘n’ Roll were the first
                gen eds I signed up for and took at this university. I was musically involved throughout high
                school, and attending school without being held accountable for something music-related felt weird.
                These courses gave me a diverse look into how music came to be, and I also learned about the wild
                history of rock ‘n’ roll and how it came to be. And when I say diverse, I mean the course taught six
                continents’ music throughout thousands of years. It was also very useful to learn how it took somebody
                with a more accepted appearance at the time, Elvis, for rock ‘n’ roll to start spreading. They were
                great introductions to how rich these courses can be.
                    I signed up for Integrated Studio Arts 308: Computer Modeling, Rendering, and Virtual Photography to
                learn some more tools pertaining to computers. It’s nothing like VHDL or any circuit design software,
                but it sounded like a fun, easy, course. As it turns out, computer modeling has a very steep learning
                curve. I struggled to understand how to manipulate my 3D models and gained a new appreciation for the
                interaction between users and their software.
                    I have learned the most from the gen ed course Leadership Studies 322: Leadership in a Diverse Society.
                LDST 322 is the course for understanding everybody’s individuality, including yourself. The class was
                structured to where we would learn a curriculum, but it was led in a way that I felt was similar to
                group therapy, so the experience was highly personalized. To finish off the course, my group presented
                the issue of food waste and food sustainability. Several countries, including ours, are terrible at
                using the food we purchase. There are some band-aid fixes, like using this wasted food for energy
                elsewhere, but stopping the problem at its source would be a better, more difficult solution.
                    Overall, I look back at these courses and see that they helped shape me into the person I am today.
                These classes opened my eyes to potential new career fields, even though I didn’t pursue them. A diverse
                experience, especially in courses, makes a more well-adjusted person.<br><br></pre>
            <h2>Ethics Paper</h2>
            <pre class="reflection">	              Without a Code of Ethics, people and companies would have more 
                motivation to only follow their personal goals. The companies that make the biggest impact usually 
                have monetary gain as their primary intention. This would produce a number of harmful consequences, 
                including companies having less transparency, jeopardizing employee safety, and even neglecting the 
                environment. Being ethical is an important quality that can benefit more than just companies, too. 
                Individuals and society as a whole should consider acting ethically for a better world.
                    Whenever I try to make a decision in any situation, especially something that could be regarded 
                as sensitive or ethical, I first keep in mind who my decision is affecting. "Am I the only person 
                who could benefit from my choice? Is anybody getting the short end of the stick if I do this?" 
                are examples of questions I ask myself pretty often. Considering people's situations and trying 
                to help them reach their ideal state is my idea of being ethical. 
                    Two ethical issues discussed in class were the Ford Pinto and the Volkswagen emissions scandal. 
                According to our texts, the Ford Pinto was plagued by design flaws that caused the car to catch 
                fire in the event of a rear-end collision. Despite knowing about this issue, Ford chose not to 
                recall the Pinto and instead paid off victims and their families to keep the issue quiet. The 
                Volkswagen scandal involved the company deliberately installing software in their vehicles that 
                allowed them to cheat on emissions tests. The software was designed to make the cars appear to 
                be meeting emissions standards when they were being tested, but in real-world driving conditions, 
                the cars emitted up to 40 times the legal limit of certain pollutants. This was done in order to 
                make the cars appear to be more environmentally friendly than they actually were. Both of these 
                examples demonstrate a lack of ethics on the part of the companies involved. In the case of the 
                Ford Pinto, the company prioritized profits over the safety of its customers. In the Volkswagen 
                scandal, the company deliberately misled consumers and regulators in order to boost sales and 
                improve the company's image. In both cases, the companies prioritized their own interests over 
                the well-being of their customers and the general public. 
                    From looking at the class' discussions, the general consensus that we agreed on is safety is 
                more important than any form of monetary gain. Plus, safety makes sense in a commercial 
                setting as well; sacrificing safety for the sake of financial gain can often have serious 
                negative consequences. Both companies listed above prioritized profits over safety and ended 
                up facing significant legal and financial repercussions. In the case of the Pinto, Ford was 
                sued by victims and their families and faced widespread criticism for its unethical behavior. 
                In the case of Volkswagen, the company was forced to pay billions of dollars in fines and 
                damages and faced significant damage to its reputation.
                    All six of the values we went over: integrity, honesty, fidelity, charity, responsibility, 
                and self-discipline are important to remain ethical. The three ideals that are more ethical 
                than the others are honesty, integrity, and responsibility. Honestly is an important virtue 
                to possess because it allows us to build trust and respect with others. Our next ideal, 
                integrity, is an important trait for building trust and respect. Without integrity, it is 
                difficult to have trust and confidence in oneself and others, which can lead to problems in 
                personal and professional relationships. Plus, a lack of integrity means there will be a less 
                likely chance of following the other standards listed. Lastly, responsibility is the ability 
                to be accountable for one's actions and decisions. It is an essential quality to have in order 
                to be a reliable and trustworthy person. It goes hand-in-hand with integrity. Not holding yourself 
                responsible for your mistakes nullifies the idea of having virtues in the first place.
